// a.	If any of the direction controls are being pressed, increase or decrease the appropriate X and Y values of the player for that direction. This can be accomplished by multiplying the user’s control input amount by a set player speed (2 is a good number to start)
// i.	For example, pushing half-left on a gamepad joystick will make the player change their X value by -0.5*2. Pressing the down key will increase the player Y by 1*2.
// b.	Do not allow the player’s box to leave the canvas
// i.	If the x or y is less than 0, make it equal 0
// ii.	If the x+w or y+h is greater than the canvas width or height, set it to the canvas width - w or the canvas height + h. (respectively)
