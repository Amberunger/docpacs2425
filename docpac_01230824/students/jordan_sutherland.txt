My favorite activities in the class Mr. Smith runs called Computer Programming, within the Information Technology shops that the school York County Technical High School supports, is to program. But besides from programming I very much enjoy the company of my fellow students, and generally being a human with other humans, that is the thing to be as human though you know?
